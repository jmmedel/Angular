AngularJS Application
It is time to create a real AngularJS Application.

Make a Shopping List
Lets use some of the AngularJS features to make a shopping list, where you can add or remove items:
Application Explained
Step 1. Getting Started:
Start by making an application called myShoppingList, and add a controller named myCtrl to it.

The controller adds an array named products to the current $scope.

In the HTML, we use the ng-repeat directive to display a list using the items in the array.

Example
So far we have made an HTML list based on the items of an array:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<script>
var app = angular.module("myShoppingList", []); 
app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) {
    $scope.products = ["Milk", "Bread", "Cheese"];
});
</script>

<div ng-app="myShoppingList" ng-controller="myCtrl">
  <ul>
    <li ng-repeat="x in products">{{x}}</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>So far we have made an HTML list based on the items of an array.</p>

</body>
</html>

    AngularJS Services
    In AngularJS you can make your own service, or use one of the many built-in services.

What is a Service?
In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.

AngularJS has about 30 built-in services. One of them is the $location service.

The $location service has methods which return information about the location of the current web page:

Example
Use the $location service in a controller:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
<p>The url of this page is:</p>
<h3>{{myUrl}}</h3>
</div>

<p>This example uses the built-in $location service to get the absolute url of the page.</p>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $location) {
    $scope.myUrl = $location.absUrl();
});
</script>

</body>
</html>


<!--

    Note that the $location service is passed in to the controller as an argument. In order to use the service in the controller, it must be defined as a dependency

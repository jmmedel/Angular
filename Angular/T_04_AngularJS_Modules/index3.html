    Adding a Directive
AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which you can use to add functionality to your application.

For a full reference, visit our AngularJS directive reference.

In addition you can use the module to add your own directives to your applications:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" w3-test-directive></div>

<script>
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
app.directive("w3TestDirective", function() {
    return {
        template : "I was made in a directive constructor!"
    };
});
</script>

</body>
</html>

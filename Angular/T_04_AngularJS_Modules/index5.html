    myApp.js
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
The [] parameter in the module definition can be used to define dependent modules.

Without the [] parameter, you are not creating a new module, but retrieving an existing one.

myCtrl.js
app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) {
    $scope.firstName = "John";
    $scope.lastName= "Doe";
});
Functions can Pollute the Global Namespace
Global functions should be avoided in JavaScript. They can easily be overwritten or destroyed by other scripts.

AngularJS modules reduces this problem, by keeping all functions local to the module.

When to Load the Library
While it is common in HTML applications to place scripts at the end of the <body> element, it is recommended that you load the AngularJS library either in the <head> or at the start of the <body>.

This is because calls to angular.module can only be compiled after the library has been loaded.

<html>
<body>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
{{ firstName + " " + lastName }}
</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) {
    $scope.firstName = "John";
    $scope.lastName = "Doe";
});
</script>

Creating a Module
A module is created by using the AngularJS function angular.module

<div ng-app="myApp">...</div>

<script>

var app = angular.module("myApp", []); 

</script>
The "myApp" parameter refers to an HTML element in which the application will run.

Now you can add controllers, directives, filters, and more, to your AngularJS application.

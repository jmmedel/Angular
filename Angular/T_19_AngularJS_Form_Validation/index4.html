CSS Classes
AngularJS adds CSS classes to forms and input fields depending on their states.

The following classes are added to, or removed from, input fields:

ng-untouched The field has not been touched yet
ng-touched The field has been touched
ng-pristine The field has not been  modified yet
ng-dirty The field has been modified
ng-valid The field content is valid
ng-invalid The field content is not valid
ng-valid-key One key for each validation. Example: ng-valid-required, useful when there are more than one thing that must be validated
ng-invalid-key Example: ng-invalid-required
The following classes are added to, or removed from, forms:

ng-pristine No fields has not been modified yet
ng-dirty One or more fields has been modified
ng-valid The form content is valid
ng-invalid The form content is not valid
ng-valid-key One key for each validation. Example: ng-valid-required, useful when there are more than one thing that must be validated
ng-invalid-key Example: ng-invalid-required
The classes are removed if the value they represent is false.

Add styles for these classes to give your application a better and more intuitive user interface.


Example
Apply styles, using standard CSS:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>  
<style>
input.ng-invalid {
    background-color:pink;
}
input.ng-valid {
    background-color:lightgreen;
}
</style>
<body ng-app="">

<p>Try writing in the input field:</p>

<form name="myForm">
<input name="myName" ng-model="myName" required>
</form>

<p>The input field requires content, and will therefore become green when you write in it.</p>

</body>
</html>

    AngularJS Scope
    The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).

The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.

The scope is available for both the view and the controller.

How to Use the Scope?
When you make a controller in AngularJS, you pass the $scope object as an argument:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<h1>{{carname}}</h1>

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.carname = "Volvo";
});
</script>

<p>The property "carname" was made in the controller, and can be referred to in the view by using the {{ }} brackets.</p>

</body>
</html>


<!-- 

    When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) gets access to these properties.

In the view, you do not use the prefix $scope, you just refer to a propertyname, like {{carname}}.

Understanding the Scope
If we consider an AngularJS application to consist of:

View, which is the HTML.
Model, which is the data available for the current view.
Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.
Then the scope is the Model.

The scope is a JavaScript object with properties and methods, which are available for both the view and the controller.

Example
If you make changes in the view, the model and the controller will be updated:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<input ng-model="name">

<h1>My name is {{name}}</h1>

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.name = "John Doe";
});
</script>

<p>When you change the name in the input field, the changes will affect the model, and it will also affect the name property in the controller.</p>

</body>
</html>

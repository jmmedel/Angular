    What Does ngAnimate Do?
The ngAnimate module adds and removes classes.

The ngAnimate module does not animate your HTML elements, but when ngAnimate notice certain events, like hide or show of an HTML element, the element gets some pre-defined classes which can be used to make animations.

The directives in AngularJS who add/remove classes are:

ng-show
ng-hide
ng-class
ng-view
ng-include
ng-repeat
ng-if
ng-switch
The ng-show and ng-hide directives adds or removes a ng-hide class value.

The other directives adds a ng-enter class value when they enter the DOM, and a ng-leave attribute when they are removed from the DOM.

The ng-repeat directive also adds a ng-move class value when the HTML element changes position.

In addition, during the animation, the HTML element will have a set of class values, which will be removed when the animation has finished. Example: the ng-hide directive will add these class values:

ng-animate
ng-hide-animate
ng-hide-add (if the element will be hidden)
ng-hide-remove (if the element will be showed)
ng-hide-add-active (if the element will be hidden)
ng-hide-remove-active (if the element will be showed)
Animations Using CSS
We can use CSS transitions or CSS animations to animate HTML elements. This tutorial will show you both.

To learn more about CSS Animation, study our CSS Transition Tutorial and our CSS Animation Tutorial.

CSS Transitions
CSS transitions allows you to change CSS property values smoothly, from one value to another, over a given duration:

Example:
When the DIV element gets the .ng-hide class, the transition will take 0.5 seconds, and the height will smoothly change from 100px to 0:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<style>
div {
  transition: all linear 0.5s;
  background-color: lightblue;
  height: 100px;
}

.ng-hide {
  height: 0;
}

</style>

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular-animate.js"></script>

<body ng-app="myApp">

<h1>Hide the DIV: <input type="checkbox" ng-model="myCheck"></h1>

<div ng-hide="myCheck"></div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngAnimate']);
</script>

</body>
</html>

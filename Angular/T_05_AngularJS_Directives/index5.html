    The ng-app Directive
The ng-app directive defines the root element of an AngularJS application.

The ng-app directive will auto-bootstrap (automatically initialize) the application when a web page is loaded.


The ng-init Directive
The ng-init directive defines initial values for an AngularJS application.

Normally, you will not use ng-init. You will use a controller or module instead.

You will learn more about controllers and modules later.


The ng-model Directive
The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-model directive can also:

Provide type validation for application data (number, email, required).
Provide status for application data (invalid, dirty, touched, error).
Provide CSS classes for HTML elements.
Bind HTML elements to HTML forms.
Read more about the ng-model directive in the next chapter.


Create New Directives
In addition to all the built-in AngularJS directives, you can create your own directives.

New directives are created by using the .directive function.

To invoke the new directive, make an HTML element with the same tag name as the new directive.

When naming a directive, you must use a camel case name, w3TestDirective, but when invoking it, you must use - separated name, w3-test-directive:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body ng-app="myApp">

<w3-test-directive></w3-test-directive>

<script>
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
app.directive("w3TestDirective", function() {
    return {
        template : "<h1>Made by a directive!</h1>"
    };
});
</script>

</body>
</html>

    The ng-repeat directive actually clones HTML elements once for each item in a collection.

The ng-repeat directive used on an array of objects:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="" ng-init="names=[
{name:'Jani',country:'Norway'},
{name:'Hege',country:'Sweden'},
{name:'Kai',country:'Denmark'}]">

<p>Looping with objects:</p>
<ul>
  <li ng-repeat="x in names">
  {{ x.name + ', ' + x.country }}</li>
</ul>

</div>

    AngularJS is perfect for database CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) applications.
Just imagine if these objects were records from a database.

AngularJS Directives
AngularJS lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.

AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which offers functionality to your applications.

AngularJS also lets you define your own directives.

AngularJS Directives
AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ng-.

The ng-app directive initializes an AngularJS application.

The ng-init directive initializes application data.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="" ng-init="firstName='John'">

<p>Input something in the input box:</p>
<p>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="firstName"></p>
<p>You wrote: {{ firstName }}</p>

</div>

</body>
</html>

<!-- 
    
    The ng-app directive also tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of the AngularJS application.

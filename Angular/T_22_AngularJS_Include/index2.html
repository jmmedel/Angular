    Include AngularJS Code
The HTML files you include with the ng-include directive, can also contain AngularJS code:

myTable.htm:
<table>
<tr ng-repeat="x in names">
<td>{{ x.Name }}</td>
<td>{{ x.Country }}</td>
</tr>
</table>
Include the file "myTable.htm" in your web page, and all AngularJS code will be executed, even the code inside the included file:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="customersCtrl"> 
  <div ng-include="'myTable.htm'"></div>
</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('customersCtrl', function($scope, $http) {
    $http.get("customers.php").then(function (response) {
        $scope.names = response.data.records;
    });
});
</script>

<p>The HTML, and AngularJS code, for this table are located in the file "myTable.htm".</p>

</body>
</html>

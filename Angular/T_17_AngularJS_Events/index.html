AngularJS Events

AngularJS has its own HTML events directives.

AngularJS Events
You can add AngularJS event listeners to your HTML elements by using one or more of these directives:

ng-blur
ng-change
ng-click
ng-copy
ng-cut
ng-dblclick
ng-focus
ng-keydown
ng-keypress
ng-keyup
ng-mousedown
ng-mouseenter
ng-mouseleave
ng-mousemove
ng-mouseover
ng-mouseup
ng-paste
The event directives allows us to run AngularJS functions at certain user events.

An AngularJS event will not overwrite an HTML event, both events will be executed.

Mouse Events
Mouse events occur when the cursor moves over an element, in this order:

ng-mouseenter
ng-mouseover
ng-mousemove
ng-mouseleave
Or when a mouse button is clicked on an element, in this order:

ng-mousedown
ng-mouseup
ng-click
You can add mouse events on any HTML element.

Example
Increase the count variable when the mouse moves over the H1 element:

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<h1 ng-mousemove="count = count + 1">Mouse Over Me!</h1>

<h2>{{ count }}</h2>

</div>
<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.count = 0;
});
</script> 

</body>
</html>
